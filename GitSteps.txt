Basics

1. Create a folder
2. Navigate to that folder in terminal
3.
  'git init'
  This will convert a local folder into a local git repository.
4. Now add files, or create a project.
5. There are 3 states in git.
  a. Untracked (All modified files which are not added staging. Files in this state will not be committed.)
  b. Staging (This state holds a copy of files that are ready to be committed. This copy will not be changed even if the original file is changed. To reflect the changes, you have to re-add them)
  c. Commited (Committed means the local files are same as that of in the repo.)

Commit Types

1. Checkout Commit: (safe) Go back to a previous revision in read only form. Cannot modify the code(This is to preserve the commit history).
      Commands:
            a. 'git checkout <revision number>'
                  Switches to a previously commited revision.
            b. 'git checkout master'
                  Switches back to latest commit

2. Revert Commit: (medium risk) This creates a new commit with reverting changes from a specified commit in history.
3. Reset Commit: (dangerous) This resets back to revision in history. This will remove all intermediate commits made from that point till today
